
The test automation solution designed based on below frameworks for Screen validation :-
Java
Selenium

TestNg

The solution uses the Page Object Model design pattern for implementing and executing the test cases.

The TestPlan document is created to cover high level topics with bullet points which is used to define any E2E Test Plan process and methodology. [ eg: TestPlan_LoginFeature.docx]

The Test cases are written in detailed manner for Login scenario. [ eg: Login_Test_Cases.xlsx ]

Unable to Login using invalid credentials

The project creates the html report based on testNg or Cucumber methodology.

I have also submitted another documents which defines the area of improvement which I could not implement due to time constraint.
